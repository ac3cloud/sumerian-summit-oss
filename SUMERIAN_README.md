### Add in Auth
We need auth added to allow polly, sumerian to work with the AWS services.


```
amplify add auth
```

```
amplify push
```


### Hack in unauthenticated access


Find the "unauth role" in IAM/Roles

Add the following inline policy:
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "sumerian:ViewRelease"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "polly:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```
